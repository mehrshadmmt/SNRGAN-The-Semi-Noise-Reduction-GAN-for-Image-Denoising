## Description
This repository contains the implementation and resources for the paper “Semi Noise Reduction GAN (SNRGAN) for Efficient Noise Reduction”. Conventional noise reduction methods often struggle with high noise levels, leading to artifacts and distortions. In this work, we propose a low-complexity Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approach for noise reduction, termed SNRGAN. Our model effectively learns noise patterns and generates denoised images across various noise levels.

The model was trained on three diverse datasets, achieving superior PSNR and NMSE scores compared to traditional methods. SNRGAN demonstrated strong performance in both subjective evaluations and objective metrics, making it a promising solution for real-world noise reduction applications.
